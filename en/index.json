Using contrastive learning and cross-modal attention, it aligns 2D manual steps with 3D parts, predicts assembly order, and refines poses, achieving state-of-the-art performance on PartNet and IKEA-Manual datasets. The method demonstrates strong generalization to real-world scenarios, significantly improving accuracy and robustness in automated assembly tasks.

The proposed method uses composite queries combining visual features and positional embeddings, reducing overlaps and correcting temporal misalignment.

To study this problem and evaluate the effectiveness of their method, they introduce a new dataset: IAW—for Ikea assembly in the wild—consisting of 183 hours of videos from diverse furniture assembly collections and nearly 8,300 illustrations from their associated instruction manuals and annotated for their ground truth alignments. They define two tasks on this dataset: First, nearest neighbor retrieval between video segments and illustrations, and, second, alignment of instruction steps and the segments for each video. Extensive experiments on IAW demonstrate superior performance of their approach against alternatives.
