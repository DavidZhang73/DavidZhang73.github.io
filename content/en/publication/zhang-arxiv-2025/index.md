abstract: "Assembling furniture amounts to solving the discrete-continuous optimization task of selecting the furniture parts to assemble and estimating their connecting poses in a physically realistic manner. The problem is hampered by its combinatorially large yet sparse solution space thus making learning to assemble a challenging task for current machine learning models. In this paper, we attempt to solve this task by leveraging the assembly instructions provided in diagrammatic manuals that typically accompany the furniture parts. Our key insight is to use the cues in these diagrams to split the problem into discrete and continuous phases. Specifically, we present Manual-PA, a transformer-based instruction Manual-guided 3D Part Assembly framework that learns to semantically align 3D parts with their illustrations in the manuals using a contrastive learning backbone towards predicting the assembly order and infers the 6D pose of each part via relating it to the final furniture depicted in the manual. To validate the efficacy of our method, we conduct experiments on the benchmark PartNet dataset. Our results show that using the diagrams and the order of the parts lead to significant improvements in assembly performance against the state of the art. Further, Manual-PA demonstrates strong generalization to real-world IKEA furniture assembly on the IKEA-Manual dataset."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: "This paper presents a transformer-based framework that leverages instructional diagrams to guide 3D part assembly, addressing challenges in sequencing and pose estimation. Using contrastive learning and cross-modal attention, it aligns 2D manual steps with 3D parts, predicts assembly order, and refines poses, achieving state-of-the-art performance on PartNet and IKEA-Manual datasets. The method demonstrates strong generalization to real-world scenarios, significantly improving accuracy and robustness in automated assembly tasks. (Generated by ChatGPT4o)."

  caption: "An illustration of the manual-guided 3D part assembly task. Given (a) a diagrammatic manual book demonstrating the step-by-step assembly process and (b) a set of texture-less furniture parts, the goal is to (c) infer the order of parts for the assembly from the manual sequence and predict the 6DoF pose for each part such that the spatially transformed parts assembles the furniture described in the manual."
